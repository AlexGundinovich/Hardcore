I'll set my sail,

  Fly the wind it will take me
                
  Back to my home, sweet home

 Lie on my back 

 Clouds are making way for me
               
  I'm coming home, sweet home
  
  (Build that wall and)
I see your star
  
(Build it strong cause)
You left to burning for me
                              
(We'll be there before too long)
Mother, I'm here
